About me Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Cezar (or Cesar).
I design and build systems in the cloud. I work on software that must feel invisible to end-users, software that is capable, reliable and highly available. The software I usually build deals almost exclusively with other machines rather than humans. You guessed it - I design and build infrastructure, servers and microservices.
Feel free to reach out to me, either on LinkedIn or via email, or book a meeting right now!</description></item><item><title>Random stuff</title><link>https://cezarmathe.com/random/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cezarmathe.com/random/</guid><description>Nothing here yet.</description></item></channel></rss>
