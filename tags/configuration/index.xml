You spend hours trying to replicate the workflow and configurations, because someone didn&#39;t take the time to back up his dotfiles. But hey, at least you&#39;re trying now.
Before we start Go through your home directory, ~/.config and other folders that might contain configurations. Also, make sure that you DO NOT include private information like ssh and gnupg keys!</description></item></channel></rss>
