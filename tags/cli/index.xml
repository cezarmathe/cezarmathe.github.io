Which means that my Portfolio section gets outdated quite quick.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I thought about creating a utility that automates the process of recording and processing my work, hence I came up with the name PWRP, which stands for Personal Work Recorder Processor. You can find this project here.
I decided to write this utility in Go because I love this programming language and it would be a very good opportunity for me to learn more about it.</description></item></channel></rss>
